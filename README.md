# Burcu Basaran

 I am Burcu, an aspiring IT-Project Manager based in Germany. After finishing my PhD in Anglophone Studies, I was looking
                    for a profession that would challenge me every day and bring me closer to my hobby of coding.
                    Project management and I are a perfect match, it enables me
                    to be creative, work with great teams, and solve problems.
                    When I'm not trying to center my divs, I like to travel the world (and try all the different kinds
                    of food). When I'm home, I try to go out and do gardening as much as possible.
                    I also love to get lost in a good game or an exciting book.
                    If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, contact me!
